# Pandas Exercise Repository

Welcome to our Pandas Exercise Repository! This repository is designed to help you sharpen your Pandas skills through a series of practical exercises. Each exercise is contained in its own Jupyter Notebook, featuring questions and gaps for you to fill in with your solutions.

### How It Works
1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone your forked repository** to your local machine.
3. Navigate to each Jupyter Notebook. You'll find a series of exercises, each associated with a **different dataset**.
4. **Read the questions** carefully and **fill in the gaps** with your code to arrive at the correct solutions.
5. Once you've completed the exercises, **push your solutions** to your forked repository.

### Getting Started
- Make sure you have [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html) installed in your Python environment.
- Familiarize yourself with Jupyter Notebooks if you haven't already.
- Each notebook contains instructions specific to the dataset and exercises it includes.
